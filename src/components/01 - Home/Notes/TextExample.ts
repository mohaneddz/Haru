export const TextExample = `# Notes

## Example Equation

Here is an example of a LaTeX equation:

$$E = mc^2$$

You can also write inline equations like $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

## More Examples

Display math:
$$\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

Inline math: The area of a circle is $A = \\pi r^2$.`;

const line1 = `const TextExample = `;
const line2 = `# Notes`;

const line3 = `## Example Equation`;
const line4 = `Here is an example of a LaTeX equation:`;
const line5 = `$$E = mc^2$$`;
const line6 = `You can also write inline equations like $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.`;

export const lines = [line1, line2, line3, line4, line5, line6];
